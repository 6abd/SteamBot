# SteamBot
SteamBot is a Steam/Discord integration bot I created. As of now, you can search for games and add them to your wishlist for notifications on sales. I am open to suggestions of additional features and optimizations. If someone knows a different way to get the information from Steam, please contact me, as the API has recently started throwing errors and missing some games.

**Update: The bot was banned from sending requests to Discord, so I'm unsure of what's next. SteamAPI had also been acting up and many games, even ones that were in my own personal wishlist, have gone "missing" from their database and throw errors. This project is officially deprecated and will not function until a later date, if at any point in the future.**

***NOTE: This project is still in testing and is incomplete. The bot was also banned, so I need to get figure out why and get it back up and running.***
